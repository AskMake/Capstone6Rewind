  - Hey Vick, there you are.
  - So here is the deal...
  - 'A while back, Tina dropped me this notebook. Said it was for you. Mentioned
    something about a party downtown. The ''End of the World'' shindig. '
  - You two were close, right? How did that turn out? Actually, never mind. As your
    dealer, I've learned not to ask too many questions.
  - 'Thing is, I haven''t seen her since she gave me this. It''s been... a while.
    People are starting to talk.  '
  - 'Anyway, here''s the notebook. Maybe it''ll shed some light on where she went.
    Or why she vanished. '
  - 'Just... be careful, Vick. Sometimes, the answers we''re looking for aren''t
    the ones we want to find."  '
